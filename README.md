# AgSteward Project | Pradeep Sekar

This is a sample app created for the AgSteward project, as part of a technical interview.

You can find more information about the requirements of the technical challenge [here](https://github.com/LapisIT/react-nextjs-challenge).

This is also a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Deployed on Vercel

This Next.js project has been deployed to [`agsteward-project-mapbox-nextjs.vercel.app`](https://agsteward-project-mapbox-nextjs.vercel.app/).

Check out the official [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details and options.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or
yarn dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit.
